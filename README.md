INVERTER

This project was to make an dc-ac inverter rated at 10 amps at 15V.  
It is composed of a dc-dc variable voltage regulator connected to a variable frequency AC power inverter.
Voltage is controlled with a pot.  There is also a current monitor on the back of the DC-DC converter.
One unit has been built.  But there were heating issues with the BJTs.

Feel free to use but USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!
